App Overview
Name: Game & Expense Tracker
Description: A playful, multi-feature mobile-web application designed to track game scores, manage group finances (loans/expenses), and visualize analytics. It combines social finance tools (like Splitwise) with game logging (like a poker ledger), wrapped in a vibrant, cartoon-inspired aesthetic.

Select multiple individual Friends.
Select Groups: Automatically expands to include all members of that group.
Splitting Logic:
Equally: Divide total amount by (Selected Participants + 1 for Payer).
Unequally: Manual input for each participant. Total amount auto-updates to match the sum of splits. Includes validation to ensure math adds up.
